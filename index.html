        <strong>Spices</strong> A spice is a seed, fruit, root, bark, or other
        plant substance primarily used for flavoring or coloring food. A spice
        may be available in several forms: fresh, whole dried, or pre-ground
        dried. Generally, spices are dried. Spices may be ground into a powder
        for convenience. A whole dried spice has the longest shelf life.
